# Simple Java Code Editor 

## Notes 

* **Keyword count uses the java AST, thus it only counts valid if statements, while statements, and for statements. ** 
* Compile All will copmile all project files. Similar to visual studio, if a file is not part of a project it will not be able to compile. 
* Compiling a file auto-save that file. Compiling Main will auto-save the project, and compiling all will auto save-all.  
* As of right now the ClassLoader does not work if the program requires user input.  
* If your program requires user input use the execute in the build menu.
