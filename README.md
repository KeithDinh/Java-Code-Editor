# Simple Java Code Editor 

## Notes 

* **Keyword count uses the Java Abstract Syntax Tree, thus it only counts valid if statements, else statements, while statements, and for statements. If the statment is not valid, it will not be counted as a keyword. Invalid keywords are those found in strings or comments or those that do not have a valid condition.** 
* Compile All will copmile all project files. Similar to visual studio, if a file is not part of a project it will not be able to compile. 
* Compiling a file auto-save that file. Compiling Main and compile all will auto-save the project.
* As of right now the ClassLoader does not work if the program requires user input.  
* If your program requires user input use the execute in the build menu.
