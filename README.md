# Simple Java Code Editor 

## Notes 

* **Keyword count uses the Java Abstract Syntax Tree, thus it only counts valid if statements, else statements, while statements, and for statements. If the statment is not valid, it will not be counted as a keyword. Statements outside of methods, i.e. invalid, will not be counted because they will cause a compilation error. ** 
* Compile All will copmile all project files. Similar to visual studio, if a file is not part of a project it will not be able to compile. 
* Compiling a file auto-save that file. Compiling Main will auto-save the project, and compiling all will auto save-all.  
* As of right now the ClassLoader does not work if the program requires user input.  
* If your program requires user input use the execute in the build menu.
