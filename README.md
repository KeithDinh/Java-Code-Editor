# Simple Java Code Editor 

## Notes 

* As of right now the ClassLoader does not work if the program requires user input.  
* If your program requires user input use the execute in the build menu. 
* Compiling a file auto-save that file. Compiling Main will auto-save the project, and compiling all will auto save-all.
